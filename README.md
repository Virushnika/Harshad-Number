# Harshad-Number
This Java program checks if a number is a Harshad Number (divisible by the sum of its digits). It reads an integer n, calculates the sum of its digits using the findsum method, and checks if n is divisible by that sum. If true, it prints "Harshad Number"; otherwise, it prints "Not Harshad Number".
